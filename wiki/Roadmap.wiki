#summary Roadmap of items to work on in the future

= Roadmap =

At current there are very few things on the roadmap for this project as it is relatively self-contained. However
as time permits, we will attempt to resolve the remaining issues (or close them if we cannot verify or get
further input). Additionally, below are some of the goals for the next version. 

== 0.6 - Target Completion by Q3 2015 ==

  * Migrate App Engine login utilities to Google API from GData [https://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/wiki/MigratingToGoogleApiJavaClient]
  * Migrate library to Gradle base (AndroidStudio Compatibility pending resolution of issue [https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=64957])
  * Support for XSRF Servlets (RpcToken support was added in 0.5)
  * Verification and testing enhancement of the LoginUtil properties for GAE in POJ and Android Library
  * Conversion to Git Repository from current SVN
  * Support Code Splitting of Gwt systems - Patch available in Issue 20 but needs significant testing to verify
